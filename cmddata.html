               <h3></h3>
               <p>
                  What makes a person? To help answer this, we will use the Star
                  Trek episode, "The Measure of a Man." This episode centers
                  around Commander Data's status, as either a person or an
                  android. The trial has three central participants: Data(the
                  defendant), Picard(defending Data), and Maddox(the plaintiff).
                  Maddox argues that Data is not sentient and is therefore not
                  entitled to the rights of living things. Picard asks Maddox
                  what is required for something to be sentient, to which Maddox
                  lays out three conditions he considers necessary for
                  sentience.

            <div class="job job-1">
               <h3>Sentience</h3>
               <h6>Intelligence</h6>
               <p>
                  The first condition is intelligence. Intelligence is defined
                  as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills,
                  something humans and animals can do. As AIs advance and learn,
                  they may begin to learn new methods to more efficiently
                  process data. In doing so, they would then fullfil the first
                  condition.
               </p>
               <p class="hidden"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-2">
               <h3>Sentience</h3>
               <h6>Self-Awareness</h6>
               <p>
                  The second condition is self-awareness, which can be defined
                  as knowledge as one's own existence. This knowledge can
                  include knowing about our feelings and desires, and even a
                  particular situation we may be in. Currently, known AIs lack
                  self-awareness, as they are unable to think without data.
               </p>
               <p class="hidden"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-3">
               <h3>Sentience</h3>
               <h6>Consciousness</h6>
               <p>
                  The third and final condition is consciousness. While it may
                  seem the same as self-awareness, there is a difference. Where
                  self-awareness is the perception of a situation, consciousness
                  can be seen as consideration of the situation, the "what" vs.
                  the "why." Consciousness can be seen as asking why something
                  is occurring, instead of simply observing it. To give an
                  example, when we see something, self-awareness is the
                  recognition that we see something. Consciousness, on the other
                  hand, is us asking why we see that thing. "What allows us to
                  see it?" "What happens in our eyes to see this thing?"
