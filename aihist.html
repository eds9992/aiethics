                  Before we get into the ethics of artificial intelligence, we
                  need do discuss what exactly it is an how it operates. In
                  addition, we will also discuss the origins and evolution of
                  artificial intelligence.

               <h3>Beginnings</h3>
               <h6>Conception</h6>
               <p>
                  The concept of artificial beings have been around for
                  centuries, dating as far back as the Greek Empire, with the
                  giant Talos. Artificial intelligence as we understand it today
                  has its roots in Alan Turing's "Theory of Computation," which
                  states that by switching between 0's and 1's, a machine can
                  simulate mathematical deduction. This theory would eventually
                  lead researchers to theorize about building an electronic
                  brain.

               <h3>Beginnings</h3>
               <h6>Development</h6>
               <p>
                  The development that is considered to be the first artificial
                  intelligence was developed by two researchers, Warren
                  McCullouch and Walter Pitts, who made a formal design for
                  Turing-complete artificial neurons. The field of AI research
                  itself began in 1956 at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project
                  on Artificial Intelligence, where attendees developed programs
                  that learned strategies for checkers, solved word and algebra
                  problems, and even learned English.

               <h3>Beginnings</h3>
               <h6>Evolution</h6>
               <p>
                  As computers advanced, so too did AI. Faster computers and
                  improvements allowed for advances in machine learning, with
                  many companies adopting some form to collect and sort through
                  increasing amounts of data. The year 2015 saw Google use AI on
                  more than 2,700 projects; Bloomberg's John Clark attributes
                  this increase to more accessible neural networks and a rise in
                  cloud computing, research tools, and data sets.

               <h3>How An AI Operates</h3>
               <h6>Algorithms</h6>
               <p>
                  Most modern day AIs use advanced algorithms to process and
                  learn from data they take in. These algorithms help to train
                  an AI on a specific dataset so that overtime, it will get
                  better at identifying patterns in other similar datasets. The
                  three most common algorithms used are neural networks, machine
                  learning, and deep learning.

               <h3>How An AI Operates</h3>
               <h6>Neural Networks</h6>
               <p>
                  Designed to mimic how our minds operate, one of the more
                  common algorithms makes use of something called a neural
                  network. These use a series of nodes that pass data to other
                  nodes upon certain conditions. Initially, a neural network
                  starts with two layers, the input and the output layers.
                  Between these two initial layers, lie hidden layers where the
                  given data is processed and passed between layers until it
                  finally reaches the output layer.

               <h3>How An AI Operates</h3>
               <h6>Human Brain vs. Neural Network</h6>
               <p>
                  As neural networks were designed after our own brains, there
                  are similarities between their structures. Both have an
                  output, an input, and various "layers" between them that
                  process data to come to a conclusion. However, there are many
                  differences between the two, which will be covered in the next
                  section.
